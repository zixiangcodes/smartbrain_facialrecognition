# Context:
A long time ago in 2020-2021, I was working on this. This was before AI tools. I had an error that I wasn't able to resolve and gave up on fixing this project. Came back after a long break to properly fix this. This is the updated repo.

# Instructions:
1. Clone this repo
2. Run `npm install`
3. Run `npm start`

# Getting Started with Create React App

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).
