# A modified updated version of SmartBrain - 
Final project for ZTM course <https://www.udemy.com/course/the-complete-web-developer-zero-to-mastery/>
Original Repo: https://github.com/aneagoie/smart-brain

# Context:
A long time ago in 2020-2021, I was working on this. This was before AI tools. I had an error that I wasn't able to resolve and gave up on fixing this project. Came back after a long break to properly fix this. This is the updated repo.

# Instructions:
1. Clone this repo
2. Run `npm install`
3. Run `npm start`
4. You must add your own API key in the `controllers/image.js` file to connect to Clarifai API
5. Add your own database credentials to `server.js` line 12

You can grab Clarifai API key [here](https://www.clarifai.com/)

Note:
- Make sure you use postgreSQL instead of mySQL for this code base.

















# Getting Started with Create React App

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.

The page will reload when you make changes.\
You may also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can't go back!**

If you aren't satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you're on your own.

You don't have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn't feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn't be useful if you couldn't customize it when you are ready for it.

## Learn More

You can learn more in the [Create React App documentation](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/getting-started).
