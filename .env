# Set the environment variable when starting your React app:
REACT_APP_BACKEND_URL=https://smartbrain-facialrecognition-api.netlify.app
# REACT_APP_BACKEND_URL=http://localhost:3000
# REACT_APP_BACKEND_URL=http://your-backend-url

# For production, set the environment variable on your hosting platform.

# This approach allows you to easily change the backend URL without modifying the code.
# This makes it more flexible for different environments and easier to deploy.
# Remember to update your backend code to listen on the port provided by the environment (often available as process.env.PORT) 
# instead of a hardcoded port number.
